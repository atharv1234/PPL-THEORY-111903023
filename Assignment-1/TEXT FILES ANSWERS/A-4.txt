        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled?

        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?

1.  with no initialisation and explicit size the arrays are declared
   . Initialisation takes place one element per statement on scope entry.

2.

3. To mark the arrays as invalid at scope exit - probably to simplify analysis
   and permit reuse of stack slots, etc.
