Questions
---------

        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?

        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?

        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?

1. two times, even though the operands are in different order. It is only computed once
   after the FRE pass.

2. We can check if there have been further optimisations by checking
   B-4.c.*.optimized, which is the final file after optimisation. It appears
   that redundant assignments have subsequently been eliminated

3.
