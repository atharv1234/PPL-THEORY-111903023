        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?

        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?

        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

1. more like ssa. Maybe (D) means it's missing a definition (e.g. c is undefined in its use in the first conditional).

2. The syntax of phi statements is probably PHI < prec_1, prec_2, ... prec_n > where
   prec_i is name(bb) - name being the name of the variable and bb the number of
   the basic block in which it was declared. There will be a prec_i for ecah
   preceding BB from which control flow can enter the current BB.

3. from cascading if-else blocks.
