        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

1. The while loop is corresponded by bb3 and 4. bb2 avoids the execution of iteration
   unconditionally by having an goto(unconditional) to bb4 which is the while
    conditional loop. Its absolutely different from the if-else jumps, which are conditional seeming.

2. bb5:initialization of outer loop variable
   bb10:outer loop conditional check
   bb6:inner loop induction variable initialisation
   bb8:inner loop conditional check
   bb7:inner loop body + induction variable increment
   bb9:iuter loop induction variable increment
